# Python Projects

This directory contains Python projects and scripts focused on **security engineering, cloud security, and automation**.

These projects are designed to demonstrate how I use Python to:
- Automate security tasks
- Improve detection and visibility
- Reduce manual effort and human error
- Support cloud and infrastructure security workflows

---

## Purpose

The goal of this directory is to showcase **practical Python usage** in a security context, including:

- Security automation
- Log analysis and parsing
- AWS and cloud-related scripting
- Detection engineering support
- Incident response tooling

Each project emphasizes **clarity, correctness, and security relevance** over complexity.
