# AWS Notes

This directory contains my structured notes and technical understanding of core **Amazon Web Services (AWS)** concepts as I prepare for a **Cloud Security Engineer** role.

These notes focus on **how AWS services work, how they are secured, and how they are monitored**, not just surface-level definitions.

---

## Purpose

The goal of this directory is to:

- Build strong foundational knowledge of AWS services
- Understand security implications of common architectures
- Support hands-on security labs elsewhere in this repository
- Create reference material I can explain confidently in interviews

These notes directly support my hands-on labs in:
- IAM hardening
- Secure networking
- Logging and detection
- Incident response

---

## Topics Covered

Current and planned areas include:

- **Core AWS Services**
  - EC2
  - S3
  - VPC
  - IAM
  - RDS (as needed)

- **Identity & Access**
  - IAM users, roles, and policies
  - Least privilege principles
  - MFA and access control patterns

- **Networking Fundamentals**
  - Public vs private subnets
  - Security groups vs NACLs
  - Internet gateways and NAT gateways

- **Logging & Monitoring**
  - CloudTrail
  - CloudWatch
  - VPC Flow Logs
  - High-signal vs low-signal logging

- **Security Concepts**
  - Shared Responsibility Model
  - Common cloud misconfigurations
  - Blast radius reduction
  - Detection vs prevention

---

## How These Notes Are Used

These notes are **not standalone projects**. They are used to:

- Prepare for hands-on AWS security labs
- Inform architectural and security decisions
- Support GitHub lab write-ups with clear explanations
- Ensure I can explain *why* a control exists, not just *how* to configure it

Hands-on implementations live in sibling directories such as:
- `iam-hardening/`
- `secure-vpc/`
- `logging-detection/`

---

## Format

Notes are written in Markdown and organized by topic or module.  
Each note emphasizes:
- Practical understanding
- Security relevance
- Real-world tradeoffs

---

## Status

This directory is **actively maintained and expanded** as I progress through AWS security-focused learning and labs.
