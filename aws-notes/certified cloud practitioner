# AWS Notes

# Day 1: First day of learning AWS and beginning to study for AWS Cloud Practitioner certification

# Module 1: Introduction to the Cloud

# What is cloud computing?
  - Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing

# The 3 Deployment Types
  - Cloud-based
      - "Includes the flexibility to migrate exisisting resources to the cloud"
  - On-Premises
      - "Deploying resources on premises using virtualization and resource management tools does not provide many of the 
         benefits of cloud computing. However, it is sometimes sought for its ability to provide dedicated resources and 
         low latency"
  - Hybrid
      - "cloud-based resources and on-premises infrastructure work together. This approach is ideal for situations where              legacy applications must remain on premises due to maintenance preferences or regulatory requirements."

# AWS Cloud Benefits
  - Variable expense. Pay for what you use
  - Dynamically scalable
  - Increased speed and agility when deploying applications and services
  - Don't have to maintain your own datacenters

# AWS Datacenters are seperated by regions to ensure high availability and fault tolerance. Within these regions are smaller sub regions (there are a minimum of 3 of these within each region) called "availabilty zones" or AZs for short in order to ensure redundancy.

# AWS has a shared security model which splits responsibility for certain things between the customer and AWS.
  - Things that are the customer's responsibility include customer data or client-side data encryption (Security IN the cloud)
  - Things the vary by service include server-side encryption, network traffic protection, platform and application management, along with OS, network and firewall configurations
  - Things that are AWS's responsibility include software for computing,storage,databases,networking as well as the hardware and AWS global infrastructure (Security OF the cloud)

# What did I learn?
  - I learned about Cloud Computing, the AWS Shared Responsibility Model and Regions and Availability Zones and many benefits and use cases that businesses could stand to gain from implementing a variety of cloud services.

# Module 2: Compute in the Cloud

# What does "compute" refer to?
  - Compute refers to the processing power needed to run applications, manage data, and perform calculations

# What is EC2?
  - Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is a powerful compute service from AWS

# Benefits and Features of EC2
  - Pay for what you use
  - Amazon handles the hardware and datacenters
  - Highly flexible and resizeable. Can start and stop EC2 instances at your request
  - EC2 instances are VMs
  - Multi-tenancy is when an underlying physical host machine shares many different instances of VMs
  - Hypervisors help make sure the tenants have resource availability while keeping instances seperate
  - You can choose your OS and software and applications that are installed
  - Vertically scaling an instance is when you provision the same VM more resources such as RAM or CPU (cores)
  - You control the networking aspect of EC2. So, you decide what type of requests make it to your server 
    and if they are publicly or privately accessible
  - EC2 is compute as a service
  - Launching Amazon Machine Image (AMI) is how you define the OS and additional software to install. You also choose an
    instance type and allocate underlying hardware resources
  - You can connect to instances with SSH and RDP or AWS Systems Manager

# AWS EC2 Instance Types
  - General Purpose: provide a balanced mix of compute, memory, and networking resources. 
    They are ideal for diverse workloads, like web services, code repositories
  - Compute Optimized: Compute optimized instances are ideal for compute-intensive tasks, 
    such as gaming servers, high performance computing (HPC), machine learning, and scientific modeling.
  - Memory Optimized: Memory optimized instances are used for memory-intensive tasks like processing large datasets, 
    data analytics, and databases.
  - Accelerated Computing: Accelerated computing instances use hardware accelerators, like graphics processing units (GPUs), 
    to efficiently handle tasks, such as floating-point calculations, graphics processing, and machine learning.
  - Storage Optimized: Storage optimized instances are designed for workloads that require high performance for locally 
    stored data, such as large databases, data warehousing, and I/O-intensive applications.

# How AWS uses APIs
  - Everything in AWS uses APIs! (Application programing interface)
  - These APIs give you predetermined ways to interact with AWS services and they are used to configure, manage, and
    provision your resources
  - APIs can be called via the AWS Management Console, the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI), or the AWS Software Development
    Kit (SDK)

# AWS Management Console
  - Good for a browser based interface that helps complete tasks such as:
    - Setting up test environments
    - Viewing billing info
    - View monitoring information
    - Work with non-technical resources

# AWS CLI
  -
