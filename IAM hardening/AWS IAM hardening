## Phase 0: Account Preparation

Before implementing any IAM hardening controls, the AWS account was secured to establish a safe and compliant baseline. This phase focused on protecting the root account and eliminating unnecessary risk.

### Root Account Security

The AWS root account was secured using the following controls:

- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** was enabled on the root account to prevent unauthorized access using only a password.
- **All root access keys were removed**, ensuring the root account cannot be used programmatically.
- Root credentials were stored securely in a password manager and are not used for daily operations.

The root account is reserved strictly for **break-glass scenarios**, such as account recovery or critical billing actions. All day-to-day administrative and operational access is performed using IAM users and assumed roles.

This approach minimizes standing privilege, reduces the blast radius of credential compromise, and aligns with AWS security best practices.

## Phase 1: Identity Design

### IAM Users

Created IAM users to represent human access:

- No long-lived access keys
- Console access only
- MFA enforced on login

This reduces the risk of credential leakage and supports identity auditing.

### IAM Groups

Permissions were assigned using IAM groups rather than directly to users:

- **Admins** – administrative users
- **Developers** – non-administrative users

This approach improves scalability and simplifies permission management.
