# AWS Notes

# Day 1: First day of learning AWS and beginning to study for AWS Cloud Practitioner certification

# Module 1: Introduction to the Cloud

# What is cloud computing?
  - Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing

# The 3 Deployment Types
  - Cloud-based
      - "Includes the flexibility to migrate exisisting resources to the cloud"
  - On-Premises
      - "Deploying resources on premises using virtualization and resource management tools does not provide many of the 
         benefits of cloud computing. However, it is sometimes sought for its ability to provide dedicated resources and 
         low latency"
  - Hybrid
      - "cloud-based resources and on-premises infrastructure work together. This approach is ideal for situations where              legacy applications must remain on premises due to maintenance preferences or regulatory requirements."

# AWS Cloud Benefits
  - Variable expense. Pay for what you use
  - Dynamically scalable
  - Increased speed and agility when deploying applications and services
  - Don't have to maintain your own datacenters

# AWS Datacenters are seperated by regions to ensure high availability and fault tolerance. Within these regions are smaller sub regions (there are a minimum of 3 of these within each region) called "availabilty zones" or AZs for short in order to ensure redundancy.

# AWS has a shared security model which splits responsibility for certain things between the customer and AWS.
  - Things that are the customer's responsibility include customer data or client-side data encryption (Security IN the cloud)
  - Things the vary by service include server-side encryption, network traffic protection, platform and application management, along with OS, network and firewall configurations
  - Things that are AWS's responsibility include software for computing,storage,databases,networking as well as the hardware and AWS global infrastructure (Security OF the cloud)

# What did I learn?
  - I learned about Cloud Computing, the AWS Shared Responsibility Model and Regions and Availability Zones and many benefits and use cases that businesses could stand to gain from implementing a variety of cloud services.

# Module 2: Compute in the Cloud
